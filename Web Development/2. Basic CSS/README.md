## Overview
- CSS constrols the presentation of the HTML content (i.e. makes it look good)
- Different browsers apply different default styles to HTML content (e.g. margins, font-size)
- Sometimes, you have to override these default styles with CSS in order to make your webpage look better
- CSS contains a set of stylistic rules that target specific element of your HTML
- - all \<p> elements will be red
- - all \<div> elements with class = 'center' will be centered
- - all \<h1> elements inside a \<div> element will be bold
- Every CSS rule looks like this: **SELECTOR** *{ DECLARATION; }* (e.g. p {color: red;})
- - the SELECTOR will be used to select a group of HTML documents
- - the DECLARATION will have a property (e.g. color) followed by a colon and a value (e.g. red). It will always end with a semicolon
